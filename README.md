K3s Setup Guide
In this repository, I will outline all the steps to set up a K3s Kubernetes cluster.

Overview
This setup will demonstrate how to configure a K3s cluster with:

One master node: Your local computer
One worker node: A Raspberry Pi device
The guide will take you through each step to connect these nodes into a functional Kubernetes cluster.
